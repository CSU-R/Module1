# Repo for the CSU R Module 1 Course

This is the repository for the Module 1 R course offered at Colorado State University.
The output bookdown document is hosted via github pages here:


[Bookdown Page](https://csu-r.github.io/Module1/)


The project is configured so that changes made on a local machine are then built into bookdown output locally, which is then pushed to the repo to update the live site.
Output is placed in the docs directory (instead of _book), so that github pages can host from there.

The project is still under construction, and we welcome any feedback or contributions you wish to make.
