# Course Preliminaries {#prelim}

This course is presented as a [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) document, and is divided into chapters and sections
Each week, you'll be expected to read through the chapter and complete any associated exercises, quizzes, or assignments.


### Special Boxes

Throughout the book, you'll encounter special boxes, each with a special meaning.
Here is an example of each type of box:


```{block, type='reflect'}
This box will prompt you to pause and reflect on your experience and/or learning. No feedback will be given, but this may be graded on completion.
```

```{block, type='assessment'}
This box will signify a quiz or assignment which you will turn in for grading, on which the instructor will provide feedback.
```

```{block, type='progress'}
This box is for checking your understanding, to make sure you are ready for what follows.
```

```{block, type='video'}
This box is for displaying/linking to videos in order to help illustrate or communicate concepts.
```

```{block, type='caution'}
This box will warn you of possible problems or pitfalls you may encounter! 
```

```{block, type='bonus'}
This box is to provide material going beyond the main course content, or material which will be revisited later in more depth.
```

```{block, type='feedback'}
This box will prompt for your feedback on the organization of the course, so we can improve the material for everyone!

Any of the boxes may include hyperlinks like this: [I am a link](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/)
```

### How This Book Displays Code

In addition, you may see R code either as part of a sentence like this: `1+1`, or as a separate block like so:
```{r, example_codeblock}
1+1
```

Sometimes (as in this example) we will also show the __output__ (in yellow), that is, the result of running the R code. In this case the code `1+1` produced the output `2`.
If you hover over a code block with your mouse, you will see the option to copy the code to your clipboard, like this:
```{r, fig.cap="copying code from this book", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("src/images/copy_code.png")
```
This will be useful when you are asked to run code on your computer.

### Next Steps

When you're ready, go to the next section to learn about the course syllabus and grading policies.

## Running your first R Code

Enough of the boring stuff, let's run some R code!
Normally you will run R on your computer, but since you may not have R installed yet, let's run some R code using a website first.
As you run code, you'll see some of the things R can do.
In a browser, navigate to [rdrr.io/snippets](https://rdrr.io/snippets/){target="_blank"}, where you'll see a box that looks like this:

```{r, fig.cap="rdrr code entry box", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("src/images/rdrr.png")
```

The box comes with some code entered already, but we want to use our own code instead, so delete all the text, starting with `library(ggplot2)` and ending with `factor(cyl))`.
In its place, type `1+1`, then click the big green "Run" button.
You should see the `[1] 2` displayed below.
So if you give R a math expression, it will evaluate it and give the result.
Note: the "correct answer" to $1+1$ is `2`, but the output also displays `[1]`, which we won't explain until later(TODO), so you can ignore that for now.

Next, delete the code you just wrote and type (or copy/paste) the following, and run it:
```{r, eval=F}
factorial(10)
```
The result should be a very large number, which is equivalent to $10!$, that is, $10\times9\times8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1$.
This is an example of an R _function_, which we will discuss more in Section (TODO: insert ref).

Aside from math, R can produce plots. Try copy/pasting the following code into the website:
```{r, eval=F}
x <- -10:10
plot(x, x^2)
```
You should see points in a scatter plot which follow a parabola.
Here's a more complicated example, which you should copy/paste into the website and run:
```{r, eval=F}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
ggplot(mtcars, aes(y=mpg, fill=as.factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title="Engine Fuel Efficiency vs. Number of Cylinders", y="MPG", fill="Cylinders") + 
  theme(legend.position="bottom", 
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank())
```
R can be used to make many types of visualizations, which you will do more of in Section (TODO: insert ref).


```{block, type="bonus"}
This may be the first time you've seen R, so it's okay if you don't understand how to read this code. We'll talk more later about what each statement is doing, but for now, here is a brief description of some of the code above:

- <span style="color:black">`-10:10`<span> This creates a sequence of numbers starting from -10 and ending at 10. That is, <span style="color:black">$-10, -9, -8, \ldots, 8, 9, 10$<span>.
- <span style="color:black">`library`<span> This is a function which loads an R _package_. R packages provide extra abilities to R.

```



## What do you hope to get out of this course?  {#getoutoftheclass}

To close out this chapter, it would be healthy for you to reflect on what you'd like to get from this course. 
Take some time to think through each question below, and write down your answers.
It is fine if your honest answer is _I don't know_. 
In that case, try to come up with some possible answers that _might_ be true.

```{block, type="reflect"}
1. Why are you taking this course?
1. If this course is required for your major, how do you think it is supposed to benefit you in your studes?
1. What types of data sets related to your field of study may require data analysis?
1. What skills do you hope to develop in this course, and how might they be applied in your major and career?
```
TODO: canvas assignment?

Store your answers in a safe place, and refer to them periodically as you progress through the course.
You may find that you aren't achieving your goals and that some adjustment to how you are approaching the course may be necessary.
Or you may find that your goals have changed, which is fine!
Just update your goals so that you have something to refer back to.


## What is R? 

What is R? This question can be answered several different ways.
Here are a few of them:

### R is a Programming Language

A programming language is a way of providing instructions to a computer.
Some popular languages (in no particular order) are C, C++, Java, Python, PHP, Visual Basic, and Swift.
Much like other types of languages, programming languages combine text and punctuation (syntax) to create statements which provide meaningful instructions (semantics) to be performed by a computer.
These instructions are called "code".
R code can be used to do many things, but primarily R was designed to easily work with data and produce graphics. 
The R language can be used to use a computer to do the following:
- Read and process a set of data in a file or database
- Use data to compute statistics and perform statistical tests
- Produce nice looking visualizations of data
- Save data for others to use.
But this list is just the tip of the iceberg.
As you will see, R can be used to do so much more!
After the instructions are written, the R code is _run_, that is, the code is provided to the computer, and the computer performs the instructions to produce the desired results.

```{block, type="bonus"}
Many other programming languages use different syntax for the same purpose.

<span style="color:black">`#`<span> comments out a line in R and python

<span style="color:black">`%`<span> comments out a line in matlab

<span style="color:black">`//`<span> comments out a line in C++ and javascript

Similar to learning a foreign language, learning your first programming language will make it easier to understand other similar ones.
```
### R is software

R can also be thought of as the software program which runs R code.
In other words, if R code is the computer language, then the R software is what interprets the language and makes the computer follow the instructions laid out in the code.
This is sometimes called "base R".

### R is Free

The R software is free, so anyone can download R, write R code, and run the R code in order to produce results on their computer.

### R is Open Source

The R software, which runs R code, is also made up of a bunch of code called _source code_.
In addition to being free, R is also _open source_, meaning that anyone can look at the source code and understand the "deep-down nuts-and-bolts" of how R works.
In addition, anyone is able to _contribute_ to R, in order to improve it and add new features to it. 

```{block, type="reflect"}
What are the advantages of open-source software? What are some potential downsides?

Why do you think the creators of R decided to make it open source?
```


### R is an ecosystem

Another way of thinking about R is to include not only the R language and the R software, but also the community of R users and programmers, and the various "add on" software they have created for R.
These add on software are called "packages".

### R Packages

An R package is software written to extend the capabilities of base R.
R packages are often written in R code, so anyone who knows how to write R code can also create R packages.
The importance of packages cannot be understated.
One of the reasons for the incredible popularity of R is the fact that members from the community can write new packages which enable R to do more.
Sometimes packages are written to help folks in particular disciplines (e.g. psychology, geosciences, microbiology, education) do their jobs better.
Other times, packages are written to extend the capability of R so that people from many disciplines can use them.
R can be used to make web sites, interactive applications, dynamic reproducible reports, and even textbooks (like this one!).

The inclusion of R packages, combined with the free and open source nature of R software, has led to the development of a active, diverse, and supportive community of R users who can easily share their code, data, and results with one another.


```{block, type="bonus"}
[skimr](https://github.com/ropensci/skimr) provides a frictionless approach to summary statistics which conforms to the principle of least surprise, displaying summary statistics the user can skim quickly to understand their data.
```

### R Interfaces

The R software can be run in many different places, including personal computers, remote servers, and websites (as you have seen!).
R works on Windows, MAC OSX, and Linux, and 
R can be run using a terminal or command line (if you know what those are), or using a graphical user interface (with buttons you can click and such).
By far one of the most popular ways of using R is with RStudio, which is _also_ open free and open source software.
For this course, you'll be using RStudio.

## The R Community

We already mentioned that there is active community of R users around the world, ranging from novice to expert level.
Here is a partial list of venues where R users interact (aside from the official websites, none of these links should be considered an official endorsement):

1. [R Project](r-project.org): The official website for R
1. [R Project Mailing Lists](https://www.r-project.org/mail.html): Various email lists to stay informed on R related activities. The R-announce list is a good starting point, which will keep you updated on the latest releases of the R software
1. [Twitter #rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?lang=en): Many R Users are active on Twitter and you can find them
1. [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly online project that focuses on understanding how to summarize, arrange, and make meaningful charts with open source data. You can see the projects others have done by following #tidytuesday on twitter.

### Places to Get Help (If you're taking this class for credit)

TBD.

### Places to Get Help (If you're just looking at this material but aren't taking the class)

If you find yourself stuck, there are many options available to you, here are a few:

1. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is a message board where users can post questions about issues they're having. If you search for your error, there's likely already an answered question about it. If not, you can submit one with a [reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) that the active community can help you with.
1. [R Manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html): With so many R resources available on the internet, sometimes information get's "boiled down" or simplified for ease of communication. If you need the "official answer" to a question, these manuals are the place to go. Check out "An Introduction to R" for a good reference.
