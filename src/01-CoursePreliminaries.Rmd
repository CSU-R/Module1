# Course Preliminaries {#prelim}

This course is presented as a [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) document, and is divided into chapters and sections
Each week, you'll be expected to read through the chapter and complete any associated exercises, quizzes, or assignments.


### Special Boxes

Throughout the book, you'll encounter special boxes, each with a special meaning.
Here is an example of each type of box:


```{block, type='reflect'}
This box will prompt you to pause and reflect on your experience and/or learning. No feedback will be given, but this may be graded on completion.
```

```{block, type='assessment'}
This box will signify a quiz or assignment which you will turn in for grading, on which the instructor will provide feedback.
```

```{block, type='progress'}
This box is for checking your understanding, to make sure you are ready for what follows.
```

```{block, type='video'}
This box is for displaying/linking to videos in order to help illustrate or communicate concepts.
```

```{block, type='caution'}
This box will warn you of possible problems or pitfalls you may encounter! 
```

```{block, type='bonus'}
This box is to provide material going beyond the main course content, or material which will be revisited later in more depth.
```

```{block, type='feedback'}
This box will prompt for your feedback on the organization of the course, so we can improve the material for everyone!
```

### How This Book Displays Code

In addition, you may see R code either as part of a sentence like this: `1+1`, or as a separate block like so:
```{r, example_codeblock}
1+1
```

Sometimes (as in this example) we will also show the __output__ , that is, the result of running the R code. In this case the code `1+1` produced the output `2`.
If you hover over a code block with your mouse, you will see the option to copy the code to your clipboard, like this:
```{r, fig.cap="copying code from this book", echo=F}
#knitr::include_graphics("src/images/copy_code.png")
```
This will be useful when you are asked to run code on your computer.

### Next Steps

When you're ready, go to the next section to learn about the course syllabus and grading policies.



## Course Topics \& Syllabus

TODO: coming soon!


### Schedule

```{r, schedule, echo=F}
sched <- data.frame(
  Week = 1 + isoweek(course_dates) - isoweek(start_date),
  Weekday = wday(course_dates, label=T, abbr=F),
  Date = format(course_dates, "%B %d"),
  Reading = rep("", 12),
  Assignments = rep("", 12)
)
knitr::kable(sched) %>% kable_styling()
```

## Running your first R Code

Enough of the boring stuff, let's run some R code!
Normally you will run R on your computer, but since you may not have R installed yet, let's run some R code using a website first.
As you run code, you'll see some of the things R can do.
In a browser, navigate to [rdrr.io/snippets](https://rdrr.io/snippets/){target="_blank"}, where you'll see a box that looks like this:

```{r, fig.cap="rdrr code entry box", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("src/images/rdrr.png")
```

The box comes with some code entered already, but we want to use our own code instead, so delete all the text, starting with `library(ggplot2)` and ending with `factor(cyl))`.
In it's place, type `1+1`, then click the big green "Run" button.
You should see the `[1] 2` displayed below.
So if you give R a math expression, it will evaluate it and give the result.
Note: the "correct answer" to $1+1$ is `2`, but the output also displays `[1]`, which we won't explain until later(TODO), so you can ignore that for now.

Next, delete the code you just wrote and type (or copy/paste) the following, and run it:
```{r, eval=F}
factorial(10)
```
The result should be a very large number, which is equivalent to $10!$, that is, $10\times9\times8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1$.
This is an example of an R _function_, which we will discuss more in Section (TODO: insert ref).

Aside from math, R can produce plots. Try copy/pasting the following code into the website:
```{r, eval=F}
x <- -10:10
plot(x, x^2)
```
You should see points in a scatter plot which follow a parabola.
Here's a more complicated example, which you should copy/paste into the website and run:
```{r, eval=F}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
ggplot(mtcars, aes(y=mpg, fill=as.factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title="Engine Fuel Efficiency vs. Number of Cylinders", y="MPG", fill="Cylinders") + 
  theme(legend.position="bottom", 
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank())
```
R can be used to make many types of visualizations, which you will do more of in Section (TODO: insert ref).


```{block, type="bonus"}
This may be the first time you've seen R, so it's okay if you don't understand how to read this code. We'll talk more later about what each statement is doing, but for now, here is a brief description of some of the code above:

- `-10:10` This creates a sequence of numbers starting from -10 and ending at 10. That is, $-10, -9, -8, \ldots, 8, 9, 10$.
- `library` This is a function which loads an R _package_. R packages provide extra abilities to R.

```



## What do you hope to get out of this course?  {#getoutoftheclass}

To close out this chapter, it would be healthy for you to reflect on what you'd like to get from this course. 
Take some time to think through each question below, and write down your answers.
It is fine if your honest answer is _I don't know_. 
In that case, try to come up with some possible answers that _might_ be true.

```{block, type="reflect"}
1. Why are you taking this course?
1. If this course is required for your major, how do you think it is supposed to benefit you in your studes?
1. What types of data sets related to your field of study may require data analysis?
1. What skills do you hope to develop in this course, and how might they be applied in your major and career?
```
TODO: canvas assignment?

Store your answers in a safe place, and refer to them periodically as you progress through the course.
You may find that you aren't achieving your goals and that some adjustment to how you are approaching the course may be necessary.
Or you may find that your goals have changed, which is fine!
Just update your goals so that you have something to refer back to.
