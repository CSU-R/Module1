R ignores comments, but you should _not_! If you're reading code that someone else has written, it's likely that also paying attention to their comments will greatly help you to understand what their code is doing. 
It's also courteous to make good comments in your own code, if only because you may have to return to your _own_ code in the future and re-learn what it is doing!
In this book, we will use comments to help explain the R code that you will see.
