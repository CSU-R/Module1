["index.html", "R Module 1 Chapter 1 Welcome!", " R Module 1 Alex Fout1 2020-06-19 Chapter 1 Welcome! Hi, and welcome to the R Module 1 course at Colorado State University! This course is the first of three 1 credit courses intended to introduce the R programming language to those with little or no programming experience. Through these Modules (courses), we’ll explore how R can be used to do the following: Perform basic computations and logic, just like any other programming language Load, clean, analyze, and visualise data Run scripts Create reproducible reports so you can explain your work in a narrative form In addition, you’ll also be exposed to some aspects of the broader R community, including: R as free, open source software The RStudio free software Publicly available packages which extend the capability of R Events and community groups which advocate for the use of R and the support of R users More detail will be provided in the Course Topics laid out in the next chapter. 1.0.1 How To Navigate This Book To move quickly to different portions of the book, click on the appropriate chapter or section in the the table of contents on the left. The buttons at the top of the page allow you to show/hide the table of contents, search the book, change font settings, download a pdf or ebook copy of this book, or get hints on various sections of the book. The faint left and right arrows at the sides of each page (or bottom of the page if it’s narrow enough) allow you to step to the next/previous section. Here’s what they look like: Figure 1.1: Left and right navigation arrows Department of Statistics, Colorado State University, fout@colostate.edu↩︎ "],

["prelim.html", "Chapter 2 Course Preliminaries", " Chapter 2 Course Preliminaries This course is presented as a bookdown document, and is divided into chapters and sections Each week, you’ll be expected to read through the chapter and complete any associated exercises, quizzes, or assignments. 2.0.1 Special Boxes Throughout the book, you’ll encounter special boxes, each with a special meaning. Here is an example of each type of box: This box will prompt you to pause and reflect on your experience and/or learning. No feedback will be given, but this may be graded on completion. This box will signify a quiz or assignment which you will turn in for grading, on which the instructor will provide feedback. This box is for checking your understanding, to make sure you are ready for what follows. This box is for displaying/linking to videos in order to help illustrate or communicate concepts. This box will warn you of possible problems or pitfalls you may encounter! This box is to provide material going beyond the main course content, or material which will be revisited later in more depth. This box will prompt for your feedback on the organization of the course, so we can improve the material for everyone! 2.0.2 How This Book Displays Code In addition, you may see R code either as part of a sentence like this: 1+1, or as a separate block like so: 1+1 ## [1] 2 Sometimes (as in this example) we will also show the output , that is, the result of running the R code. In this case the code 1+1 produced the output 2. If you hover over a code block with your mouse, you will see the option to copy the code to your clipboard, like this: Figure 2.1: copying code from this book This will be useful when you are asked to run code on your computer. 2.0.3 Next Steps When you’re ready, go to the next section to learn about the course syllabus and grading policies.

["running-your-first-r-code.html", "2.2 Running your first R Code", " 2.2 Running your first R Code Enough of the boring stuff, let’s run some R code! Normally you will run R on your computer, but since you may not have R installed yet, let’s run some R code using a website first. As you run code, you’ll see some of the things R can do. In a browser, navigate to rdrr.io/snippets, where you’ll see a box that looks like this: Figure 2.2: rdrr code entry box The box comes with some code entered already, but we want to use our own code instead, so delete all the text, starting with library(ggplot2) and ending with factor(cyl)). In it’s place, type 1+1, then click the big green “Run” button. You should see the [1] 2 displayed below. So if you give R a math expression, it will evaluate it and give the result. Note: the “correct answer” to \\(1+1\\) is 2, but the output also displays [1], which we won’t explain until later(TODO), so you can ignore that for now. Next, delete the code you just wrote and type (or copy/paste) the following, and run it: factorial(10) The result should be a very large number, which is equivalent to \\(10!\\), that is, \\(10\\times9\\times8\\times7\\times6\\times5\\times4\\times3\\times2\\times1\\). This is an example of an R function, which we will discuss more in Section (TODO: insert ref). Aside from math, R can produce plots. Try copy/pasting the following code into the website: x &lt;- -10:10 plot(x, x^2) You should see points in a scatter plot which follow a parabola. Here’s a more complicated example, which you should copy/paste into the website and run: library(ggplot2) theme_set(theme_bw()) ggplot(mtcars, aes(y=mpg, fill=as.factor(cyl))) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title=&quot;Engine Fuel Efficiency vs. Number of Cylinders&quot;, y=&quot;MPG&quot;, fill=&quot;Cylinders&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;bottom&quot;, axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank()) R can be used to make many types of visualizations, which you will do more of in Section (TODO: insert ref). This may be the first time you’ve seen R, so it’s okay if you don’t understand how to read this code. We’ll talk more later about what each statement is doing, but for now, here is a brief description of some of the code above: -10:10 This creates a sequence of numbers starting from -10 and ending at 10. That is, \\(-10, -9, -8, \\ldots, 8, 9, 10\\). library This is a function which loads an R package. R packages provide extra abilities to R "],

To close out this chapter, it would be healthy for you to reflect on what you’d like to get from this course. Take some time to think through each question below, and write down your answers. It is fine if your honest answer is I don’t know. In that case, try to come up with some possible answers that might be true. Why are you taking this course? If this course is required for your major, how do you think it is supposed to benefit you in your studes? What types of data sets related to your field of study may require data analysis? What skills do you hope to develop in this course, and how might they be applied in your major and career? TODO: canvas assignment? Store your answers in a safe place, and refer to them periodically as you progress through the course. You may find that you aren’t achieving your goals and that some adjustment to how you are approaching the course may be necessary. Or you may find that your goals have changed, which is fine! Just update your goals so that you have something to refer back to. "],
